// In Eclipse the projects facets still have to be set up manually. (DynamicWeb, ...)
// Don't forget to set the version of the facet to the latest version
// Make sure src/main/webapp is added to the Web Deploy Assembly. Folder /WebContent is used by default in Eclipse
// ejb and war projects have to be added to the ear project manually 
// Using just war without ear is the modern approach but we show the ear way also
